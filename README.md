## Front-End Chemistry 101: Polymer

> The polymer project is what makes the Web Components of the future available to us now.
> This talk will provide a broad overview of the polymer library and its parts,
> as well as hands-on experience of integrating them into your projects.

### What's in here?
The repository contains the outline of the talk, as well as link to the [presentation](http://goo.gl/cTN34W).
Besides that, it has a demo application of web components integrated with angular application.
Lastly but not lease, `snippets` folder has many examples used all over the presentation.
